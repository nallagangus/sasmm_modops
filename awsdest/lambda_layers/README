
lambda_function_layers.zip which holds all python packages used by lambda_function.

Reason as to why layers are used over consolidating into main lambda_function_dependencies.zip.
1. Layers is the right logical way to hold packages and dependencies that do not change over time.
Code changes over time as part of lambda function is referred as part of "lambda function itself(another zip file)"
2. Secondly, lambda function will be open for editing/debugging in "AWS console" if "lambda function < few MB".
 If we are to hold all python packages as part of lamda function.zip then it is not open for editing all thhough we can stil use it.


How do we create this

1. cd to this "tmp" directory
2. pip install <<wahtever pakcage like requests kubernetes etc>> -t /tmp/python/lib/python3.7/site-packages
3. cd to /tmp
4. zip entire directory from "python" and down into 1 file as lambda_layers/lambda_layers_k8s_requests_etc_packages_1.zip
